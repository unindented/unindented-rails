        <p>Sorry, the page you’re looking for isn’t there. I’d suggest:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Checking the address for typos</li>
          <li>Visiting the <a href="/">homepage</a></li>

        <p>It looks as though something is really broken. Maybe a server is offline. Maybe the guy who wrote all this made a typo somewhere. Maybe he’s just hung over...</p>
        <p>Anyways, I’d try reloading the page. If this annoying message still shows up, please let him know at <a href="mailto:daniel@unindented.org">daniel@unindented.org</a>.</p>
